**Client:** Cool Delivery  
**Team:** OGC Team  
**Module:** Secure Cloud Architecture  
**Document Version:** 6.0

## 1. Objective

The C4 Level 4 diagram (optional) will not focus on code structure, but on how Cool Deliveryâ€™s cloud infrastructure and applications are **deployed, updated, and maintained** using **AWS services**.

The pipeline is designed to:

- Enforce secure, automated, and traceable deployments.
    
- Prevent manual errors (infrastructure drift).
    
- Integrate monitoring and rollback capabilities.

## 2. Deployment Pipeline Components

|Component|Purpose|
|---|---|
|**GitHub Repository**|Hosts application source code and Infrastructure-as-Code templates (CloudFormation or Terraform).|
|**AWS CodePipeline**|Manages CI/CD flow: trigger on code push, build, test, and deploy.|
|**AWS CodeBuild**|Builds the application and packages artifacts (e.g., Docker images if Fargate is used).|
|**AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**|Stores container images if using Fargate deployment.|
|**AWS CloudFormation (or Terraform)**|Defines and provisions AWS infrastructure automatically.|
|**AWS Elastic Beanstalk or ECS Fargate (Optional)**|Managed service for Flask application deployment.|
|**AWS S3**|Stores frontend static files (HTML/JS/CSS) deployed automatically after build.|
|**AWS CloudWatch**|Monitors build/deployment events, sends notifications on failures.|

[Webhook triggers AWS CodePipeline]
    |
    +--> [AWS CodeBuild - Backend]
    |         - Build Flask application
    |         - Run unit tests
    |         - Package into a container (if needed)
    |         - Push to AWS ECR (if containerized)
    |
    +--> [AWS CodeBuild - Frontend]
    |         - Minify JS/CSS
    |         - Build static assets
    |         - Upload to S3 Bucket (Static Website)
    |
    +--> [AWS CloudFormation (or Terraform)]
    |         - Deploy/update infrastructure: ALB, EC2, DocumentDB, VPCs, Security Groups.

## 5. Security Best Practices Integrated into Pipeline

|Area|Security Measure|
|---|---|
|Code Access|GitHub protected branches, mandatory pull requests and reviews.|
|CI/CD Access|IAM roles with least privilege, CodePipeline execution roles separated.|
|Artifact Storage|ECR image encryption, S3 encryption at rest (KMS).|
|Deployment Audits|All deployment actions logged via AWS CloudTrail.|
|Infrastructure Updates|IaC templates versioned and audited, no manual changes in AWS Console.|
|Notifications|SNS / CloudWatch Alarms on pipeline failures.|

---

## 6. Summary

The deployment pipeline is **secure**, **automated**, and **scalable**, in alignment with cloud-native DevOps principles.  
It reduces manual intervention, improves traceability, and secures both the application lifecycle and the underlying AWS infrastructure.
