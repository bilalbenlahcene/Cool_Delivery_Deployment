## 1. Objective

This phase describes the **full AWS infrastructure** required to securely deploy the Cool Delivery platform.  
It specifies:

- AWS services selected.
    
- Resource sizing.
    
- Security layers.
    
- High-availability setup.
    
- Cost-conscious design decisions.
    

This document will directly guide the actual implementation and cost estimation.

## 3. AWS Services and Architecture Choices

|Layer|AWS Service|Purpose|
|---|---|---|
|Networking|**Amazon VPC**|Private cloud network with multiple subnets (Public & Private).|
|Compute|**EC2 (or Fargate)**|Flask backend hosting (Auto-scaled for resilience).|
|Storage|**S3**|Frontend hosting, static assets, backup storage.|
|Database|**DocumentDB**|Fully managed MongoDB-compatible database for persistence.|
|Load Balancing|**Application Load Balancer (ALB)**|HTTP/HTTPS traffic management with SSL termination.|
|Monitoring|**CloudWatch**|Infrastructure, application metrics, and alerting.|
|Security|**AWS Shield Standard + WAF**|DDoS protection and application-level firewall.|
|Identity Management|**AWS IAM + AWS Cognito**|IAM for internal resources, Cognito for user authentication.|
|Deployment|**CodePipeline + CodeBuild + S3 + ECR**|Full CI/CD deployment stack.|
|Backup & Recovery|**S3 Snapshots + AWS Backup**|Database snapshots, backup policies for critical assets.|
|DNS & Emails|**Route53 + SES**|Domain name management and transactional emails.|

## 4. Detailed Networking Architecture

- **VPC**: One VPC dedicated to Cool Delivery.
    
- **Availability Zones**: 2 or 3 AZs for high availability (multi-AZ design).
    
- **Subnets**:
    
    - **Public Subnet**: ALB, NAT Gateway.
        
    - **Private Subnet**: EC2 instances, DocumentDB, internal services.
        
- **Routing**:
    
    - Internet Gateway for public access.
        
    - NAT Gateway for private subnets outbound access.
        
- **Security Groups**:
    
    - Allow only HTTPS (443) inbound to ALB.
        
    - Allow ALB to talk to EC2 over HTTP/HTTPS.
        
    - Allow EC2 to access DocumentDB on the database port (27017).
        
    - Full internal deny-all except explicitly allowed flows.

## 5. Resource Sizing (Initial Setup)

| Service                | Resource Type                  | Initial Size            | Scaling                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| EC2 Instances          | t3.small (or t3.medium)        | 2 instances (HA)        | Auto-Scaling Group (CPU > 70%) |
| DocumentDB             | db.t3.medium                   | 1 Primary + 1 Replica   | Multi-AZ enabled               |
| S3 Buckets             | Standard storage class         | Estimated 10 GB initial | Auto-scaling                   |
| ALB                    | Load balancer per VPC          | 1 ALB                   | Elastic Load Scaling           |
| CloudFront             | 50 GB/month transfer (startup) | Auto-scale              |                                |
| CodePipeline/CodeBuild | On-demand builds               | Pay-per-use             | Scales with pushes             |

## 6. Redundancy and Resilience

- **Multi-AZ deployment** for EC2 and DocumentDB.
    
- **Auto-scaling** for EC2 backend instances.
    
- **S3 storage** designed for 99.999999999% durability.
    
- **ALB** with health checks and failover.

## 7. AWS Security Controls Summary

|Area|Implementation|
|---|---|
|Identity Management|IAM Policies, MFA, Cognito, Access Analyzer.|
|Network Security|Security Groups, VPC NACLs, Private Subnets.|
|Data Security|KMS Encryption (S3, EBS, DocumentDB).|
|Threat Protection|AWS WAF, AWS Shield Standard, GuardDuty.|
|Logging and Monitoring|CloudTrail enabled, CloudWatch Metrics and Alarms.|
|Backup and Recovery|AWS Backup policies, versioning on S3 Buckets.|

## 8. Additional Optimizations

- **Use EC2 Spot Instances** for non-critical background tasks.
    
- **Enable S3 Intelligent-Tiering** for logs to reduce storage costs.
    
- **Activate CloudFront caching** to reduce direct load on the backend.
    
- **Use AWS Trusted Advisor** for continuous cost and security optimization.
