**Client:** Cool Delivery  
**Team:** OGC Team  
**Module:** Secure Cloud Architecture  
**Document Version:** 2.0

## 1. Objective

This section delivers the **Level 1** diagram of the C4 Model: the **System Context Diagram** for Cool Delivery’s new AWS-based secure cloud architecture.

The **goal** is to clearly define:

- The **boundaries** of our system.
    
- The **users** interacting with the system.
    
- The **external systems** communicating with it.
    
- The **high-level AWS services** involved.
    

This provides the essential global view before decomposing into containers (next phases).

## 2. Cool Delivery Cloud System - Context Overview

Cool Delivery’s new system will be deployed fully on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** and will serve **external customers** via the Internet, while being managed securely by an **internal operations team**.

---

## 3. Primary Actors

|Actor|Description|
|---|---|
|**Customer (End-User)**|Users accessing the delivery platform via a web browser.|
|**Operations Team (Internal Admins/Developers)**|Admins responsible for deployment, maintenance, and monitoring of the system.|
|**AWS Services**|External managed services (e.g., AWS S3, RDS/DocumentDB, Cognito, CloudFront, IAM, CloudTrail).|

---


## 4. System Boundaries

- The system includes all components necessary for hosting the delivery application backend, frontend, database, and associated infrastructure within AWS.
    
- The system boundary stops at AWS service edges (for example, the internet traffic enters through AWS API Gateway or ALB).
    
- Sensitive operations (administration, logging, backup) are internal and protected from the public Internet.

## 6. Textual View

|Interaction|Flow|
|---|---|
|Customer → Frontend (CloudFront/S3)|Customers access the application via a web browser using HTTPS through AWS CloudFront.|
|Frontend → Backend (ALB → Flask API)|Frontend communicates securely with the backend via an Application Load Balancer and Flask API hosted on EC2 or serverless containers.|
|Backend → Database|Backend APIs interact with DocumentDB (or MongoDB) over secure VPC private endpoints.|
|Operations Team → AWS Management Console (IAM-protected)|Administrators manage the application via AWS Console using MFA-protected accounts.|
|AWS Services|Integrated services like CloudTrail, GuardDuty, CloudWatch are active for monitoring, auditing, and threat detection.|
|External Communication|Email alerts via AWS SES, domain management through Route53.|

## 8. Security Considerations Already Integrated

- **HTTPS everywhere**: SSL/TLS enforced from CloudFront to Backend.
    
- **IAM Roles and Policies**: Fine-grained, least privilege.
    
- **Private Subnets**: Database and backend live in private isolated networks.
    
- **WAF and Shield**: Protection against web attacks and DDoS.
    
- **GuardDuty**: Threat intelligence and anomaly detection.
