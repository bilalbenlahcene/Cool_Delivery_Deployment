🛡️ **Analyse Rootkit terminée avec succès !**

Voici l’interprétation de ton rapport `rkhunter` :

---

### ✅ **Pas de rootkits détectés**

* `Possible rootkits: 0` → ton système  **n'est pas infecté** .
* Tous les checks connus sur les rootkits  **sont clean** .

---

### ⚠️ **Avertissements mineurs (pas critiques)**

1. **`Required commands check failed`** :
   * Indique que certains programmes (ex: `ifdown`, `egrep`, `fgrep`) n'ont pas passé tous les tests.
   * C’est **attendu** sur certaines distribs récentes où ces outils sont dépréciés ou absents.
2. **`passwd` et `group` file changes** :
   * `rkhunter` signale tout changement récent sur ces fichiers critiques.
   * Dans ton cas, tu as  **ajouté un utilisateur IAM (`admin-ben`) récemment** , donc  **normal** .
3. **SSH options non définies (`root login`, `Protocol v1`)** :
   * Non défini ≠ activé. Et par défaut sur Amazon Linux,  **SSH root login est désactivé** .
   * Aucun signe que ça soit ouvert ou mal configuré ici.


✅  **Bilan : propre** , avec quelques alertes normales et **sans aucune menace active** détectée.
