## 1. Objective

This phase provides a detailed decomposition of the containers (Frontend, Backend API, Database) into their internal **components**, as per the **C4 Model - Level 3**.

Each container will be broken down to highlight:

- Logical groupings of functionalities.
    
- Data flows between components.
    
- Interactions with AWS services and external systems.

## 2. Backend API Container — Components

The Flask Backend (hosted on EC2/Fargate) will be decomposed into the following components:

|Component|Purpose|
|---|---|
|**Authentication Manager**|Handles user login, token generation, password reset using AWS Cognito integration.|
|**Delivery Management Service**|Core logic to manage orders, track deliveries, update statuses.|
|**Customer Profile Service**|Manages user data (addresses, payment info, preferences).|
|**Admin Panel API**|Restricted endpoints for internal management (only accessible via specific roles).|
|**Email Notification Service**|Triggers AWS SES to send order confirmations, updates, alerts.|
|**Monitoring Agent**|Logs application events and metrics to CloudWatch.|

---

## 3. Frontend (S3 Static Website) — Components

Although hosted statically, the frontend is logically organized into the following:

|Component|Purpose|
|---|---|
|**Authentication Module**|UI for user login, signup, session management.|
|**Delivery Dashboard**|Displays ongoing and past deliveries, real-time updates via API.|
|**Profile Manager**|Allows customers to edit their profile, addresses, payment information.|
|**Admin Dashboard (Restricted)**|Only accessible for internal operations team members.|
|**Notification Center**|Displays alerts/messages based on user actions or system events.|

---

## 4. Database (Amazon DocumentDB) — Logical Collections

|Collection|Purpose|
|---|---|
|**Users**|Store user account details, roles, and authentication references (external to Cognito tokens).|
|**Deliveries**|Stores active and completed delivery orders with statuses, timestamps, geolocation data.|
|**Notifications**|Stores system-triggered messages for customer notification center.|
|**Audit Logs**|Keeps track of critical API events, login attempts, administrative actions.|

## 6. Security Between Components

| Communication                    | Security Mechanism                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend → Backend API           | HTTPS with TLS 1.2+ enforced.                                                                        |
| Backend API → Cognito            | OAuth2/OpenID Connect secure integration.                                                            |
| Backend API → DocumentDB         | VPC private endpoints, encrypted at rest (KMS) and in transit.                                       |
| Backend Components Communication | Internal service authentication (IAM roles, if microservices evolve).                                |
| Admin Dashboard                  | Role-based access control enforced at both frontend (UI hiding) and backend (authorization headers). |
