**Team:** OGC Team  
**Module:** Secure Cloud Architecture  
**Document Version:** 2.0

## 1. Introduction

A crucial part of designing a secure cloud architecture is understanding the potential threats and vulnerabilities that could compromise the system. This Threat Modeling document leverages the **STRIDE framework**, adapted specifically for cloud environments on **AWS**, combined with real-world cloud threat scenarios.

The objective is to identify potential threats early and define clear mitigation strategies aligned with AWS services and best practices.

## 2. Threat Modeling Framework

OGC Team applies the **STRIDE** framework to categorize potential threats:

| STRIDE Category            | Threat Type                              |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **S**poofing               | Identity impersonation                   |
| **T**ampering              | Data or system modification              |
| **R**epudiation            | Action denial without accountability     |
| **I**nformation Disclosure | Unauthorized information access          |
| **D**enial of Service      | Service disruption                       |
| **E**levation of Privilege | Unauthorized access to higher privileges |
Additionally, **cloud-specific risks** (e.g., misconfigurations, account compromise, insecure APIs) are considered.

## 3. Assets to Protect

- **User Accounts (IAM Users, Roles)**
    
- **Web Application Frontend**
    
- **Flask Backend API**
    
- **MongoDB Database / Amazon DocumentDB**
    
- **AWS Networking Resources (VPC, Subnets, Gateways)**
    
- **Logging and Monitoring Systems (CloudTrail, CloudWatch)**
    

---

## 4. Identified Threats and Risks

### ➔ S: Spoofing

- Attackers might attempt to impersonate users or services.
    
- **Risk**: Unauthorized access to management consoles or APIs.
    

**Mitigation:**

- Enforce **AWS IAM policies** with least privilege.
    
- Enable **AWS MFA** for all privileged accounts.
    
- Use **AWS Cognito** or similar for application-level authentication.
    
- Enable **IAM roles** for service-to-service authentication (instead of keys).
    

---

### ➔ T: Tampering

- Attackers might alter data (e.g., database contents, files in S3).
    
- **Risk**: Data corruption, business disruption.
    

**Mitigation:**

- Use **AWS KMS** (Key Management Service) for data encryption at rest and in transit.
    
- Implement **AWS Config** to detect unauthorized changes.
    
- Use **WAF (AWS Web Application Firewall)** to filter malicious HTTP requests.
    
- Enable **S3 Object Lock** for immutable storage where needed.
    

---

### ➔ R: Repudiation

- Attackers or insiders may deny performing critical actions.
    
- **Risk**: Loss of audit trail, inability to trace incidents.
    

**Mitigation:**

- Enable **AWS CloudTrail** for full API call logging.
    
- Activate **AWS CloudWatch Logs** for detailed application logging.
    
- Implement centralized log storage with integrity controls (e.g., AWS S3 bucket with logging).
    

---

### ➔ I: Information Disclosure

- Sensitive data could be exposed through insecure APIs, storage buckets, or weak access controls.
    
- **Risk**: Data breaches and compliance violations.
    

**Mitigation:**

- Use **IAM policies** to strictly limit access to resources.
    
- Apply **S3 Bucket Policies** to enforce private access.
    
- Encrypt all data using **AWS KMS** and enforce **TLS 1.2+** in transit.
    
- Use **Secrets Manager** for storing sensitive keys and passwords instead of hard-coding.
    

---

### ➔ D: Denial of Service (DoS)

- Attackers might flood application endpoints or overload resources.
    
- **Risk**: Service unavailability leading to revenue loss and reputational damage.
    

**Mitigation:**

- Implement **AWS Shield Standard** (included by default) for basic DDoS protection.
    
- Set up **AWS WAF** to filter bad traffic and rate-limit.
    
- Use **Auto Scaling Groups** to absorb traffic surges.
    
- Distribute traffic through **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** with multiple Availability Zones.
    

---

### ➔ E: Elevation of Privilege

- Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities to gain admin-level access.
    
- **Risk**: Full system compromise.
    

**Mitigation:**

- Use **least privilege** access principles in IAM policies.
    
- Conduct regular **IAM Access Analyzer** audits.
    
- Implement **multi-tiered authentication** (IAM + MFA + session policies).
    
- Review **EC2 instance roles** and **Lambda execution roles** periodically.

## 5. Cloud-Specific Threats

| Threat                            | Mitigation                                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Misconfigured S3 buckets          | Enforce encryption and public access blocking on all S3 buckets.            |
| Exposed APIs                      | Implement API Gateway with authorization and throttling.                    |
| Stolen Access Keys                | Rotate access keys regularly and monitor with CloudTrail.                   |
| Shadow IT (untracked deployments) | Enforce deployments only via Infrastructure as Code (e.g., CloudFormation). |
| Lack of monitoring/visibility     | Centralize logs and alerts in CloudWatch/GuardDuty/Security Hub.            |

## 6. Risk Prioritization Matrix


|Threat|Impact|Likelihood|Priority|
|---|---|---|---|
|Data Breach via S3|Critical|Medium|High|
|DoS Attack on Frontend|High|High|High|
|Insider Abuse (IAM Misuse)|High|Medium|High|
|API Injection Attacks|High|Low|Medium|
|Credential Theft|Critical|Low|High|

## Conclusion

By proactively identifying and mitigating these risks, OGC Team will ensure that Cool Delivery’s new AWS-based cloud infrastructure will be **secure by design**, **resilient against attacks**, and **ready for regulatory compliance**.

Threat modeling will directly inform the next phase: **the construction of the C4 diagrams**, ensuring that each risk has corresponding design elements (e.g., segmented VPCs, private endpoints, WAF protection, IAM hardening).
