## Introduction

In the digital age, cloud migration has become a strategic imperative for businesses seeking scalability, resilience, and enhanced security. Cool Delivery, an emerging leader in the delivery services market, has initiated a migration project to transition its delivery application to a cloud-native environment.

The OGC Team has been commissioned to architect and deploy a **secure, cost-effective, and highly available cloud infrastructure** using **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.  
This document outlines the overall project objectives, scope, approach, and standards, with a particular emphasis on the use of the **C4 Model** for a rigorous architectural representation.

## 2. Context and Problem Statement

Cool Delivery's web application currently includes:

- A **client-side interface** based on **HTML/JavaScript/CSS**.
    
- A **Python Flask API backend**.
    
- A **MongoDB database**.
    

Operating on legacy on-premise infrastructure, the platform faces challenges around security, scalability, and operational efficiency.  
Migrating to AWS offers the opportunity to:

- Leverage **AWS managed services**.
    
- Improve security posture through **AWS-native security controls**.
    
- Achieve **elastic scalability**.
    
- Optimize operational costs through **serverless and auto-scaling options**.

## 3. Project Objectives

The OGC Team is tasked with delivering the following:

- **Architectural Document:** A professional-grade AWS-based architecture, following the C4 Model structure.
    
- **Security Strategy:** Integration of AWS security services (IAM, VPC Security Groups, AWS Shield, etc.).
    
- **Prototype Deployment:** Implementation of at least one fully functional environment (Development, QA, or Production) on AWS.
    
- **Cost Optimization:** Leveraging AWS best practices (e.g., right-sizing, auto-scaling groups, reserved instances).
    
- **Professional Presentation:** A high-quality, business-level presentation showcasing the solution.

## 4. Architectural Approach: **C4 Model**

To ensure a comprehensive and structured design, OGC Team will use the **C4 Model**, breaking down the architecture into four logical views:

| C4 Level                            | Description                                                                               | Outcome                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Level 1: System Context Diagram** | Positioning Cool Deliveryâ€™s application within the AWS ecosystem and external actors.     | Clear identification of users, services, boundaries.                       |
| **Level 2: Container Diagram**      | Detailed overview of major AWS services (EC2, RDS, S3, Lambda, etc.).                     | Service interactions, security zones, data flow.                           |
| **Level 3: Component Diagram**      | Internal structure of each container (microservices, Flask backend, MongoDB collections). | Component responsibilities and security interconnections.                  |
| **Level 4: Code (Optional)**        | Software design patterns and pipelines (e.g., CI/CD through AWS CodePipeline).            | Provided if needed to explain deployment pipelines or critical components. |
This methodology ensures a high degree of scalability, maintainability, and professionalism.

## 5. Project Phases and Deliverables

The Secure Cloud Architecture project will proceed through the following phases:

|Phase|Deliverable|
|---|---|
|1|Threat Modeling and Risk Assessment (focused on AWS threats)|
|2|AWS Service Selection and Design Decisions|
|3|C4 Model Diagrams (Context, Container, Component)|
|4|AWS Infrastructure Prototype Deployment|
|5|Cost Estimation (AWS Pricing Calculator)|
|6|Documentation and Final Presentation|
Each phase is structured to build upon the previous one to ensure continuity and completeness.

## 6. Assumptions and Constraints

- The cloud provider is **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.
    
- The web application must support three environments: **Development**, **Quality Assurance (QA)**, and **Production**.
    
- MongoDB may be implemented either via **Amazon DocumentDB** (preferred for managed services) or via a secure self-hosted MongoDB cluster on EC2.
    
- All environments must be isolated via AWS VPCs, subnets, and appropriate security groups.
    
- IAM policies must enforce **least privilege** at user and service level.
    
- Cost optimization will prioritize **managed services**, **serverless components** where appropriate, and **resource right-sizing**.
    
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be enabled on all administrative accounts.

## 7. Core Architectural Principles

OGC Team will adhere to the following best practices throughout the project:

- **Defense-in-Depth:** Network, application, and data security layers using AWS-native features.
    
- **Zero Trust:** No implicit trust within or outside AWS services.
    
- **High Availability:** Use of AWS regions, Availability Zones, and auto-scaling.
    
- **Elastic Scalability:** Integration of services like Elastic Load Balancing, AWS Lambda, and Auto Scaling Groups.
    
- **Cost Optimization:** Use of AWS Compute Savings Plans, reserved instances, spot instances where applicable.
    
- **Monitoring and Logging:** AWS CloudTrail, CloudWatch, GuardDuty, and third-party SIEM integration.
    
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Usage of AWS CloudFormation or Terraform for deployment automation.
